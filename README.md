### Hi, welcome on my Github page !
(Currently building this page)

I'm an engineering school third year student at Efrei Paris. 
I'm currently looking for a **fourth year internship** related to **Embedded Systems** going from November 2023 to March 2024 (XX weeks).
I'm avaible all over Europe, I speak english (900 at the Toeic test), and **french** is my native language.
I've done my last semester abroad in Montreal (Concordia University) and can't wait to discover a new country !

If you wish to contact me, here is my email address:
## Through my scolarship I've learned a lot :
  - I work with several languages : C, C++, Java, Python, SQL and web (javaScript, HTML, CSS) using Vue JS
  - With a particulatiar interest in algorithmic and data structures (see my Rubicks Cube project in C)
  - I use VHDL as a description language for FPGA (see my microcontroller project)
  - Throughout the other courses I've followed, I've learned the basics in operating systems (Linux Mint is my daily OS), computer architecture and networks. I also have a mathematics background with a project in graphe theory and an introductive class to operationnal research.
## My work with team mates, those projects are transversale :
- Iscale (2nd year project) \n
