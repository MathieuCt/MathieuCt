I'm an engineering school third year student at Efrei Paris. 
I'm currently looking for a **fourth year internship** related to **Embedded Systems** going from November 2023 to March 2024 (XX weeks).
I'm avaible all over Europe, I speak english (900 at the Toeic test), and **french** is my native language.
I've done my last semester abroad in Montreal (Concordia University) and can't wait to discover a new country !
