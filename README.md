### Hi, welcome on my GitHub page!
(Currently building this page)

I'm an engineering school third year student at Efrei Paris. 
I'm currently looking for a **fourth-year internship** related to **Embedded Systems** going from the 6th November 2023 to the 7th April 2024 (20 weeks).
I'm available all over Europe, I speak **English** (900 at the Toeic test), and **French** is my native language.
I've done my last semester abroad in Montreal (Concordia University) and can't wait to discover a new country!

## Through my scholarship I've learned a lot:
  - I work with several languages: C, C++, Java, Python, SQL and web (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) using Vue JS
  - With a particular interest in algorithmic and data structures (see my [*Rubik's Cube project*](https://github.com/MathieuCt/rubiks_efrei) in C)
  - I use VHDL as a description language for FPGA (see my [*microcontroller*](https://github.com/MathieuCt/Semestre6-VHDL) project)
  - Throughout the other courses I've followed, I've learned the basic of operating systems (Linux Mint is my daily OS), computer architecture and networks. I also have a mathematics background with a project in [*graph*](https://github.com/MathieuCt/Semestre6-Theorie-des-graphes/) theory and an introductive class to operational research.
##  With my teammates, we've worked on transversal projects:
